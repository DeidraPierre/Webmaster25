  <h1 id = "mission">Our Mission</h1>
  <p id = "descrip1">Elemental Eatery was born from a desire to merge the beauty of nature with a transformative dining experience. Inspired by the four classical elements—Fire, Water, Earth, and Air—our founders envisioned a space where culinary artistry would meet environmental consciousness. </p>
  <p id = "descrip2">As a fully vegan restaurant, we are committed to showing that plant-based dining can be bold, creative, and deeply satisfying. Every dish is crafted using fresh, organic ingredients without compromising on flavor or texture.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Sustainability</h2>
    <p>At Elemental Eatery, we believe in protecting the planet as fiercely as we pursue culinary excellence. Our sustainability efforts are woven into every aspect of our operation.</p>
